<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>

We use BannerBomb3 to install menuhax67, which lets us access the Homebrew Launcher. From there, we launch nimdsphax which launches SafeB9SInstaller. 

See [here](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimdsphax) for information about nimdsphax and [here](https://github.com/zoogie/menuhax67) for information about menuhax67.

    + If the console freezes for a while and then crashes, make sure you have Launcher.dat on the root of your SD card
1. If the exploit was successful, your console will have booted into the Homebrew Launcher
1. Launch nimdsphax from the list of homebrew
1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller
    + If your console freezes on a red screen, hold the POWER button until it turns off, then retry this section

1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare` on your SD card
1. Delete `F00D43D5.bin` from your Nintendo DSiWare folder and from your computer. This file will not be needed anymore
