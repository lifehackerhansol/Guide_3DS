## Things you should know about the 3DS

<summary><strong>3DS/2DS compatibility</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/compatible.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

This guide works with every retail console in the Nintendo 3DS family of consoles (including the 3DS, 3DS XL/LL, 2DS, New 3DS, New 3DS XL/LL, and New 2DS XL/LL), regardless of region or firmware.

<summary><strong>Computer compatibility</strong></summary>

{: .notice--info}
You can follow this guide as long as you are able to download files from the Internet and copy them to your SD card. Depending on your computer/phone/electronic device, you may need to purchase a USB to SD card adapter to allow your computer to read your SD card.

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>SD card location, type, and capacity</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/sdcard.jpg" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

The location of the SD card slot and the type of SD card that is accepted depends on the model of your 3DS. More information can be found on [Nintendo's official support page](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/271/~/how-to-insert-an-sd-card-or-microsd-card).

The 3DS can read SD cards of any capacity (even those larger than 32GB), but the card must be formatted as FAT32 (**not** exFAT or NTFS). You can use one of the following tools to format your SD card, depending on your operating system: [Windows](formatting-sd-(windows)), [macOS](formatting-sd-(mac)), [Linux](formatting-sd-(linux)). SD cards larger than **128GB** are not recommended due to known issues with custom themes and GBA/DS graphics.

To follow this guide, you'll need an SD card with a capacity of at least **2GB**.
{: .notice--warning}

If you want, you can check your SD card for errors before following this guide using [H2testw (Windows)](h2testw-(windows)), [F3 (Linux)](f3-(linux)), or [F3XSwift (Mac)](f3xswift-(mac))

<summary><strong>Potential risks (Disclaimer)</strong></summary>

By modding your console, you subject it to the remote (but non-zero) possibility of the console being banned from online play or bricked (rendered non-functional). ___Incorrect file placement will NOT brick your console___, but purposely skipping instructions might. Similarly, the last ban wave occurred over five years ago, but there is no guarantee that another one will not occur in the future.

In short: Modding your console is safe, but it's ___your responsibility___ if something goes wrong.

## Things you need to do on your computer

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>File placement terminology (e.g. "root of SD")</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/sdroot.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

When copying files to the SD card, it is important to copy them to the right location - otherwise, the console will not detect the file and the exploit or software you are trying to use will not work. A term you will see frequently on this guide is **root of the SD card**, which means you are not inside any folder on your SD card. The directory that appears when you first open your SD card on your computer is called the 'root'.

You may also see folder names indicated like this: `/folder/`. The slashes are used to indicate directories and are not part of the name of the folder. For example, `/folder1/folder2/` would refer to `folder2` inside of `folder1`:

![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/folders.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

**Angle brackets** (\< and \>) are also occasionally used to refer to system-specific identifiers. For example, if the guide says `<ID0>`, it is referring to the system-specific identifier inside of the `Nintendo 3DS` folder, rather than a folder literally named "ID0":

<summary><strong>Downloading files from GitHub</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/github.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

In this guide, you will copy files that are downloaded on your computer/phone to your console's SD card. Many of these files come from GitHub, which is a website used by developers to publish their open-source releases. When downloading files from GitHub, you should download the file that *isn't* source code.

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>Opening/extracting files</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/zipfiles.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

Some of the files that you will be asked to download come in the `.zip` file format, which is used to package multiple files into one file.

When you are told to "copy (file) from (file).zip", that means that you need to open (or "extract") the ZIP file. Inside the ZIP file will be the file you're looking for, after which you can copy it to the specified location on your SD card.

On most operating systems, you can extract files by double-clicking the file. If this doesn't work, you can install a reputable third-party extraction tool like [7-zip](https://7-zip.org/) instead.

<summary><strong>(Windows only) File extensions</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/fileext.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

If your computer is running Windows, file extensions may be hidden by default, which may make it harder to find the files you're looking for. To enable file extensions, follow [these instructions](file-extensions-(windows)).
